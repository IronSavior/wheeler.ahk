[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that scrolls when the cursor is moved while right mouse button is held down. 

Scroll lock key toggles suspend of the script.  
It only suspends the hotkeys, so if it is suspended while holding right mouse button, the scrolling will continue until it is no longer suspended.

The cursor keeps moving during scrolling, which differs from the scrolling you see with trackpads.  
On a trackpad you can easily lift your finger to keep scrolling after you reach the edge of the trackpad.  
With a mouse it is cumbersome to lift the mouse to move it.  
When the cursor moves during scrolling, you can hold right button and scroll down which moves the cursor, 
then release the button and move the cursor back up where you started, and then repeat. 
This results in your cursor staying at around the same position on your screen while repeatedly scrolling without needing to lift the mouse.

Some people will get inflammation in the muscle that pulls the middle finger if they use the scroll wheel too much. For them this script is a life saver. 

Big thanks to [@IronSavior](https://github.com/IronSavior) who originally made this. It has served me well for many years.
